# IMDb Movie Look Up

A python script that looks up all movies in a folder on IMDb and gets the ratings, genre and plot of the movie and stores it in an excel sheet.
I wrote this to be able to decide which movie I wanted to watch from all the movies I had on my disk.

####Installation
    git clone https://github.com/prachi1210/imdb_movie_lookup.git
    cd imdb_movie_lookup
    python movie_list.py

####Demo
 Here's a sample screenshot of a spreadsheet generated with the movies I had on my disk.
